# Web Development Project 2: Computer Science Trivia Flashcards
Submitted by: Anvesh Gupta

## Project Overview
This web application is an interactive flashcard tool designed to test and enhance users' knowledge of key computer science concepts. Users can flip cards to reveal answers, navigate between cards randomly or sequentially, and visually identify difficulty levels through color-coded badges.

## Total Time Spent: Approximately 8 hours

## Required Features Implemented ‚úÖ
Card Set Information: Displays the title, a brief description, and total number of cards.

Single Card Display: Presents one card at a time, initially showing only one side of the information pair.

Interactive Card List: Created a structured list of question-answer pairs.

Flip Interaction: Clicking on a card flips it to reveal the corresponding answer or question.

Random Navigation: Implemented a "Next" button that displays a random new card each time it is clicked.

## Optional Features Implemented üöÄ
Image Integration: Cards include images either alongside or in place of text.

Visual Styling by Category: Cards have distinct visual styles (color schemes) based on their categories.

Difficulty Level Color-Coding: Cards are color-coded according to difficulty levels‚Äîeasy, medium, and hard.

## Additional Features Implemented üåü
Difficulty Badges: Added clear visual badges indicating each card's difficulty level.

Previous Button Functionality: Users can navigate back to previously viewed cards.

3D Flip Animation: Implemented smooth 3D card-flipping animations for enhanced user experience.

Robust Image Error Handling: Included error handling mechanisms for image loading issues, ensuring graceful degradation.

## Video Walkthrough üé•
Here's a walkthrough demonstrating the implemented features clearly:



## Challenges Encountered üõ†Ô∏è
Card-Flipping Animation: Ensuring smooth 3D flip animations while maintaining readability of text required careful CSS adjustments.

Image Loading & Error Handling: Managing image loading states and gracefully handling errors involved additional state management logic in JavaScript.

Badge Positioning: Precisely positioning difficulty badges so they appeared correctly on both sides of flipped cards required meticulous CSS positioning.
